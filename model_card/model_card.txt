MODEL CARD – Solar PV Detection Prototype

Model: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)

Purpose:
- Detect presence of rooftop solar panels
- Provide binary classification (present/not present)

Data Used:
- Roboflow rooftop solar datasets
- Google satellite imagery samples

Assumptions:
- Input image contains a rooftop
- Reasonable resolution for PV module visibility

Limitations:
- Shadows, clouds, water tanks may cause false negatives
- Angle distortion not fully corrected
- Area estimation is approximate (for prototype)

Recommended Improvements:
- Train model on larger India-specific dataset
- Add shadow-augmented samples
- Improve bounding box → area conversion logic

## Application

* The Solar-Panel-Detector app analyzes satellite images to detect the presence of solar panels, serving both
  environmental research and the solar energy market.
* It provides insights into potential areas for solar panel installation and aids in understanding the spread of solar
  energy usage.
* The Predictions can be made on a specific address or a given image.

If you would like to use the app with the deployed GUI you can visit:
https://huggingface.co/spaces/ArielDrabkin/Solar-Panel-Detector

--------

## Usage

To run the solar panel detector locally -

1. clone the repository with the following command:

``` 
git clone https://github.com/ArielDrabkin/Solar-Panel-Detector.git
```

2. Install the required packages with the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. The script can be executed with several command-line arguments:

* -k, --api_key: (Optional) Your API key for mapping services.
* -a, --address: (Optional) Address for prediction.
* -z, --zoom: (Optional) Image Zoom level, default is 19.
* -i, --image_dir: (Optional) Directory of images for applying predictions.
* Once you are predicting on an address the predicted image will show up and automatically be saved in the "src" folder.

4. To predict on an address, first you will need to get a Google Maps API key
   at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/get-api-key.

5. **Predicting Using Address Only:**  
   To get predictions based on an address, first update your Google Maps API key in the "secret.json" file.  
   Then use the -a or --address argument:

```
python main.py --address "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, United States"
```

6. **Predicting Using a Custom API Key:**  
   Alternatively, if you have a custom API key and wish to use it instead of the one in ../secret.json, use the -k or
   --api_key argument:

```
python main.py --api_key "YOUR_CUSTOM_API_KEY" --address "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, United States"
```

7. **Adjusting Zoom Level:**
   Zoom level is set to 19 by default, but can be adjusted according to your needs. For more information visit https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/start#Zoomlevels.  
   To adjust the zoom level of the image, use the -z or --zoom argument:

```
python main.py --address "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, United States" --zoom 18
```

8. **Predicting with Image Analysis:**  
   To perform image analysis on a specific image, ensure that the specified directory contains the image you want to
   analyze.
   use the -i or --image_dir argument:

```
python main.py --image_dir "/path/to/image/directory"
```

9. **Predict and Enjoy!**

## Training

For using the data-set:

1. Get a secret key from roboflow where the data is stored.
2. Update the secret.json file or the direct code with your key.
3. Run the following code:

```
# Load the data sets from roboflow
with open("secret.json") as file:
    roboflow_api_key = json.load(file)["roboflow_api_key"]
rf = Roboflow(api_key=roboflow_api_key)
project = rf.workspace("ariel-drabkin-tifqg").project("solar-panel-detector-imvoh")
dataset = project.version(1).download("yolov8")
```
